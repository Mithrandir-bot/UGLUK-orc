# UGLUK Tokenomics

## Supply & Distribution

**Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 UGLUK (1B)

### Distribution Strategy
- **Liquidity Pool:** 50% (500M)
- **Community Treasury:** 30% (300M)
- **Dev/Ops:** 15% (150M)
- **Horde Rewards:** 5% (50M)

## Reward Mechanics

### Swapback Rewards (10%)
Every UGLUK trade triggers rewards:
- 10% of swap volume → Horde members
- Distributed automatically via Uniswap V4 hook
- Rewards scale by NFT tier (Member/Champion/Legend)

### Tier System

| Tier | NFTs Held | Reward Rate | Benefits |
|------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Member** | 1+ | 10% | Voting, raids, leaderboard |
| **Champion** | 5+ | 15% | Early raid access, badge |
| **Legend** | 20+ | 20% | Raid organizer, weekly bonus |

## Token Economics

### Why This Works

1. **Friction removal** - Gas-free swaps attract traders
2. **Reward alignment** - Holders benefit from volume (not just holders)
3. **Community incentives** - Bigger Horde = bigger rewards
4. **Sustainable** - Rewards come from trading fees, not new supply

### Anti-Dumping

- Rewards concentrate in active traders
- Tier system encourages holding
- DAO can vote to adjust reward rates
- Treasury locked for community benefit

## Sustainability

**Monthly costs (estimate):**
- Paymaster sponsorship: $2-5K
- Infrastructure: $1K
- Development: $5K

**Monthly revenue (projected Phase 1):**
- Trading volume: $100K/month
- Uniswap fees (0.3%): $300
- Community raids: +$5-10K (if successful)

**Break-even:** Month 3-4 with 50K active traders
